However, here are some exceptions:
+ The first alphabet of function name should be lower case
+ Tabs should be used, and should be equivalent to 4 spaces. There is no space before the keywords `public`, `private` and `protected`
+ The underline after the name of class members should be moved to the front of the name
+ Stream will be used for conversion
